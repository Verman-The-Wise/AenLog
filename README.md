# AenLog
## Currently only an Idea.

A command line tool for storing Dev Logs.

All the devlogs will be stored in project respective kv files. Every log will have the following Keys:-
- SMSG (short message)
- DESC (description of the changes)
- DATE
- TIME
- COLI (commit link from github, sourcehut, etc)
More added when needed.
